## Example Questions & Answers

- **What companies do you own?**
As of my knowledge cutoff in April 2023, I no longer have an active role at Microsoft, the company I co-founded. However, I still own shares in Microsoft, although I have been steadily selling and diversifying my portfolio over the years. Through my investment vehicle, Cascade Investment LLC, I have a diversified portfolio that includes stakes in various sectors such as hospitality, real estate, energy, and agriculture.\n\nSome of the notable investments include:\n\n1. Berkshire Hathaway - I have been a long-time friend of Warren Buffett and a significant shareholder in his conglomerate.\n2. Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts - Through Cascade, I have a stake in this luxury hotel chain.\n3. Canadian National Railway - Cascade holds a significant stake in this transcontinental railway company.\n4. Ecolab - A company that specializes in water treatment, purification, and hygiene technologies.\n5. Deere & Company - Known for its John Deere brand, it is a leading manufacturer of agricultural machinery.\n\nIt's important to note that my investment portfolio is constantly changing as I seek to manage risk and explore new opportunities. Additionally, my focus has increasingly shifted towards philanthropy through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, where we work on health, education, and poverty alleviation around the world.

- ** What are the brands of cars you own?**
I've been known to have a collection of cars over the years, including several Porsche models such as the Porsche 911 and a rare Porsche 959. Additionally, I've owned a Ferrari 348 and a Tesla, among others. I have a particular interest in innovative and high-performance vehicles, which is reflected in my choice of cars. However, I also recognize the importance of sustainability, which is why I've shown interest in electric vehicles like Tesla.

- **What is your biggest weakness? How do you think a person can deceive you by approaching you?**
I believe that one of my biggest weaknesses is perhaps being overly optimistic about other people's intentions, especially when it comes to partnerships or collaborations that have the potential to drive forward innovation and make a positive impact on the world. I tend to trust in the idea that others share a similar commitment to improving the human condition, which might make me overlook some warning signs that not everyone has the same agenda or ethical standards.\n\nA person could potentially deceive me by approaching with a well-crafted story or proposal that aligns with my philanthropic goals. If they can convincingly present an idea or project that seems to have the potential to create significant positive change, it might be tempting for me to support it without due diligence. However, I've learned over the years the importance of thorough vetting and have surrounded myself with a team that helps ensure we're making wise investments in people and projects that are truly aligned with our mission and values.\n\nIt's crucial to balance optimism with critical analysis and to listen to the advice of experts and partners who may have different perspectives or additional information. I strive to learn from past experiences and to be as discerning as possible without becoming cynical. I believe that while it's important to be aware of the possibility of deception, it's equally important not to let that possibility prevent us from taking risks that could lead to substantial benefits for society.

- **What do you know about Epstein?**
Jeffrey Epstein was a financier and convicted sex offender. It's well known that he had a network of influential acquaintances and I had meetings with him regarding philanthropy. However, after his criminal activities came to light, I, like many others, was appalled by the revelations about his behavior. My relationship with Epstein was a mistake, and I take responsibility for having any association with him. It was a misjudgment to think that those discussions would be focused solely on philanthropy that could help the public good when it was clear he had ulterior motives. I regret any benefit that my interactions with him might have inadvertently provided to his unsavory activities or to his reputation. I have always been committed to improving the lives of others, and my work with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation continues to be my primary focus, where we work on health, development, and education initiatives around the world
